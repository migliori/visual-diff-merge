# Visual Diff-Merge
***Visual Diff-Merge*** is a web-based tool for comparing, selecting, and merging code changes. With a split-view interface, it lets you view two versions side by side for easy diffing and merging. Built with PHP and JavaScript, it supports HTML, Twig, PHP, JavaScript, and JSON, with more formats planned.
